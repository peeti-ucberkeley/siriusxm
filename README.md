Case Study:  
We are experiencing higher than expected calls to our Service department.  Service Agents are at full capacity which is causing long wait times for customers.  Typically, agents are skilled in a specific type of call, so they are subject matter experts.  For example, Service Agents are skilled for Service calls.  

To better assist customers, we allowed all types of agents to handle the high-volume Service calls to optimize for a better customer experience. 

Both Finance and Operations would like you to analyze if we should continue to allow agents who are not primary skilled in Service to take Service calls.  A subset of the call results is in the "data" tab of the Excel documents.   

What is your recommendation?
